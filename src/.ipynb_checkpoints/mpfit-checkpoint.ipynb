    "\n",
    " MPFIT uses the Levenberg-Marquardt technique to solve the\n",
    " least-squares problem.  In its typical use, MPFIT will be used to\n",
    " fit a user-supplied function (the \"model\") to user-supplied data\n",
    " points (the \"data\") by adjusting a set of parameters.  MPFIT is\n",
    " based upon MINPACK-1 (LMDIF.F) by More' and collaborators.\n",
    "\n",
    " For example, a researcher may think that a set of observed data\n",
    " points is best modelled with a Gaussian curve.  A Gaussian curve is\n",
    " parameterized by its mean, standard deviation and normalization.\n",
    " MPFIT will, within certain constraints, find the set of parameters\n",
    " which best fits the data.  The fit is \"best\" in the least-squares\n",
    " sense; that is, the sum of the weighted squared differences between\n",
    " the model and data is minimized.\n",
    "\n",
    " The Levenberg-Marquardt technique is a particular strategy for\n",
    " iteratively searching for the best fit.  This particular\n",
    " implementation is drawn from MINPACK-1 (see NETLIB), and is much faster\n",
    " and more accurate than the version provided in the Scientific Python package\n",
    " in Scientific.Functions.LeastSquares.\n",
    " This version allows upper and lower bounding constraints to be placed on each\n",
    " parameter, or the parameter can be held fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    " The user-supplied Python function should return an array of weighted\n",
    " deviations between model and data.  In a typical scientific problem\n",
    " the residuals should be weighted so that each deviate has a\n",
    " gaussian sigma of 1.0.  If X represents values of the independent\n",
    " variable, Y represents a measurement for each value of X, and ERR\n",
    " represents the error in the measurements, then the deviates could\n",
    " be calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "   DEVIATES = (Y - F(X)) / ERR\n",
    "\n",
    " where F is the analytical function representing the model.  You are\n",
    " recommended to use the convenience functions MPFITFUN and\n",
    " MPFITEXPR, which are driver functions that calculate the deviates\n",
    " for you.  If ERR are the 1-sigma uncertainties in Y, then\n",
    "\n",
    "   TOTAL( DEVIATES^2 )\n",
    "\n",
    " will be the total chi-squared value.  MPFIT will minimize the\n",
    " chi-square value.  The values of X, Y and ERR are passed through\n",
    " MPFIT to the user-supplied function via the FUNCTKW keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    " Simple constraints can be placed on parameter values by using the\n",
    " PARINFO keyword to MPFIT.  See below for a description of this\n",
    " keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    " MPFIT does not perform more general optimization tasks.  See TNMIN\n",

    "\t Order\t0th\t\t  1st\t\t\t\t\t  2nd\n",
    "\n",
    "   Here f'(x) is the gradient vector of f at x, and f''(x) is the\n",
    "   Hessian matrix of second derivatives of f at x.  The vector x is\n",
    "   the set of function parameters, not the measured data vector.  One\n",
    "   can find the minimum of f, f(xm) using Newton's method, and\n",
    "   arrives at the following linear equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t  f''(x0) . (xm-x0) = - f'(x0)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(2)\n",
    "\n",
    "   If an inverse can be found for f''(x0) then one can solve for\n",
    "   (xm-x0), the step vector from the current position x0 to the new\n",
    "   projected minimum.  Here the problem has been linearized (ie, the\n",
    "   gradient information is known to first order).  f''(x0) is\n",
    "   symmetric n x n matrix, and should be positive definite.\n",
    "\n",
    "   The Levenberg - Marquardt technique is a variation on this theme.\n",

    "   convergent.\n",
    "\n",
    "   In principle, if f''(x0) and f'(x0) are known then xm-x0 can be\n",

    "   compute, if even by finite difference techniques.  So-called\n",
    "   quasi-Newton techniques attempt to successively estimate f''(x0)\n",
    "   by building up gradient information as the iterations proceed.\n",
    "\n",
    "   In the least squares problem there are further simplifications\n",

    "\t   f'' = 2 Sum(hi' hj') + 2 Sum(hi hi'')\t\t\t\t(4)\n",
    "\n",
    "   If one assumes that the parameters are already close enough to a\n",
    "   minimum, then one typically finds that the second term in f'' is\n",
    "   negligible [or, in any case, is too difficult to compute].  Thus,\n",
    "   equation (2) can be solved, at least approximately, using only\n",
